full name: device receiver

It is not mature now, so don't use it on "formal occasions",but you can reference it.(2024.8.25)
It can read the data on the "mindray" monitor over a socket connection.
If you want to know more of "mindray"(TM) , browse "https://www.mindray.com".
I experimented it on mindray monitor [BeneView T5].
And,it must be "client" now (8.25),because the [BeneView T5] can only be server (?).
It cannot parsing the read data yet(8.25),but i will get a parser quickly.(if you find a good HL7 parser(sorry,it must written in C), you can send a mail to "xm_djw@qq.com",thanks!)

In the end,i just a stutent (now), and i am not from English(and all speak English countries),so my English is bad.If you find i have any spelling mistakes or you have any better(easy to understand) "spell",you can also help me change "Makefile" itself.
